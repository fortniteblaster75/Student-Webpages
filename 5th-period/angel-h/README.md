# Final Portfolio Project – Angel H

## About Me

Hi, I'm Angel H, a passionate and curious student developer with a growing interest in building interactive and engaging web experiences. I've spent this year diving into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and project-based learning, which has helped me grow my coding skills and gain confidence as a front-end developer. I enjoy taking on new challenges, solving problems, and turning ideas into digital creations.

## Project Overview

This portfolio site is the final project for my web development course and represents a summary of everything I’ve learned throughout the year. From mastering layout and design principles to building interactive games and using GitHub for version control, this project shows my progress as a developer. I’m proud of the work I’ve done and excited to share it with others.

## What's Included in My Portfolio

My portfolio website includes:
- A responsive and user-friendly design
- A homepage with navigation to featured projects and contact information
- A gallery of my main projects with links to demos and source code
- A clean layout that highlights both visual and technical aspects of my work

## Featured Projects

### 🎰 **Slots and Coinflip**
An interactive game that simulates a classic slot machine and a coin flip. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project helped me understand randomness, event handling, and basic game logic.

### 🔤 **Hangman**
A web-based version of the classic Hangman game where users guess letters to solve a hidden word. This project reinforced my understanding of arrays, string manipulation, and DOM updates.

### 🦑 **Squid Game: Red Light, Green Light**
A browser game inspired by the popular Squid Game series. Players must move only when the light is green or risk being eliminated. This project helped me learn about animations, conditional logic, and real-time interaction in the browser.
